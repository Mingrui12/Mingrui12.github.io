I am a first year Computing Science Master student at the Simon Fraser Univesrity under supervison of [Prof. Ali Mahdavi-Amiri](https://www.sfu.ca/~amahdavi/Home.html).

Before joining SFU, I was a Research Assistant at the Australian National Univesrity under the supervision of [Dr. Liang Zheng](https://zheng-lab.cecs.anu.edu.au/) and [Prof. Hongdong Li](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hongdong/). Earlier than this, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Mechatronic Engineering (Research & Development) and Mathematical Sciences at the [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/). During my undergraduate studies at ANU, I was very fortunate to collaborate with [Prof. Stephen Gould](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~sgould/) for my honors thesis.

I have particular research interests in Single View 3D Reconstruction, generative modeling and broad topics in Computer Graphics.
