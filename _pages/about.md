I am a forthcoming Ph.D. student in the School of Computing Science at Simon Fraser University, working under the supervision of [Prof. Ali Mahdavi-Amiri](https://arash-mham.github.io/) and [Prof. Richard Zhang](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~haoz/). My research focuses on Computer Graphics, with particular emphasis on Single View 3D Reconstruction, Primitive Fitting, and Generative Modeling.

Previously, I completed my M.Sc. at Simon Fraser University under the supervision of [Prof. Ali Mahdavi-Amiri](https://arash-mham.github.io/). My master's research centered on sweep surfaces based shape abstraction.Before joining SFU, I served as a Research Assistant at the Australian National University on digital plant modeling. I completed my undergraduate studies at the Australian National University with a dual degree in Mechatronic Engineering (Research & Development) and Mathematical Sciences with my honors thesis targeting on linear programming integration into deep learning networks.

Outside of academia, I enjoy solving jigsaw puzzles, playing badminton, swimming, and exploring hiking trails in British Columbia.
